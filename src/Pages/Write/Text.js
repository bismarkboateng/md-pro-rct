        text: `
        We've updated the Partner Program to incentivize high-quality human writing. Here's a quick summary: we've opened up the Partner Program to
        more locations, removed the 100 follower requirement, and require Medium membership to join. Earnings will be higher for stories that have repeat
        readers, have been Boosted, and that have a high read ratio. All stories will also earn more based on engagement signals like claps, highlights, and
        replies. Referral bonuses are being deprecated and new story stats will be added in so writers can better understand their story earnings breakdown.`,

        This includes claps, highlights, replies, and new follows. Reads and read ratios will be defined as people who read your story for 30 seconds or more divided by total views.

        text: `
        We're deprecating the Membership Referral Program and replacing it with a Follower Bonus.
        Stories that are read by and have engagement with existing followers will get an extra bonus in earnings.

        All member referrals made up until September 1, 2023 will continue to be honored indefinitely.
        We will keep your custom referral pages up so that they don't break your links in stories, 
        but we will stop generating new referrals for members who sign up after September 1st.`,
